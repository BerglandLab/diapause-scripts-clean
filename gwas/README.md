## make GDS and compute principle components and genetic relatedness matrix --> 


##run gwas for 100 imputations of raw data + 100 permutations

##summarize the mean and median statistics across the 100 imputations


##determine SNPs that fall into rare categories of missing data and
  allele frequency

 ## do 500 extra permutations of them

##run adaptive permutations

##calculate empirical p-values by comparing all real data to all
comparable permuted SNPs

##calculate permuted p-values by comparing all permutations to all
  other permutations
