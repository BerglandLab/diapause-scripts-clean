# LD Analysis

This folder contains scripts used to analyze linkage disequilibrium in hybrid swarm individuals, their parents, and the DGRP.

* files named "ld\_decay***"" analyze the decay of LD from 50 to 10,000,000 basepairs from randomly chosen focal SNPs in the DGRP, hybrid swarm, and hybrid swarm parents
* files named "long_distance_LD***" analyze LD across chromosome arms and between non-homologous chromosomes
