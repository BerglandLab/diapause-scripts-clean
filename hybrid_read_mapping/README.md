# the F4 and F5 hybrids were sequenced in three libraries, named PAE_AOB_01, PAE_AOB_02, and PAE_AOB_03. Within each library there are 960 barcoded samples. The fastq files are labeled with a number. The filenames.txt files correspond to the sample information in the order that they are numbered within each library.

#The reads were mapped with the pear_bwa_PAE_AOB_{1..3} files

#unassembled and assembled reads were merged wtih merge_bams.sh
